### Enhance Understanding with the "Don't Understand" Button
We understand that some concepts can be challenging to grasp. That's why we've added a special featureâ€”the "Don't Understand" button. If a student finds an answer difficult to comprehend, they can click the "Don't Understand" button to access a comprehensive video explanation, supporting their journey toward mastery.
